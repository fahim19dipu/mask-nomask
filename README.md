# mask-nomask

The task being done is a simple binary classification, if any given image contains a masked face or not. At first, create three seperate Dataloaders were created for training, validation and testing using the “tf.keras.utils.Sequence” and “tf.data.Dataset” function from the Tensorflow Library. The training, validation and testing part of the dataset are provided in the respective folders. A train time augmentation is added from the “albumentations” library. The augmentation being used is “albumentations.augmentations.transforms.HorizontalFlip”.the probability of the augmentation is 50%.A Model class using Three Convolutional Layers and a Single Linear Layer is created.approprate Max Pooling and Average Pooling layers are included. A Custom Training Loop using GradientTape() is cretaed to train the network with the two  losses which are  the Binary Cross Entropy (tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy) and KL- Divergence (tf.keras.losses.KLDivergence). Both Losses are used together to train the model. Adam optimizer is used to train the model.
